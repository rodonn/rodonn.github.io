11/17/21	Counterfactual inference for consumer choice across many product categories	Quantitative Marketing and Economics	Developed a variational Bayesian model of customer behavior in grocery stores to understand how they substitute between products when prices and product availability changes. Validated the ability of the model to make counterfactual predictions using held out data from weeks that experienced changes in pricing or out-of-stock products.

5/1/18	Estimating heterogeneous consumer preferences for restaurants and travel time using mobile location data	AEA Papers and Proceedings	We estimate a model of consumer choices over restaurants using data from thousands of anonymous mobile phone users. We analyze how consumers reallocate their demand after a restaurant closes and make predictions about what types of restaurants would attract the most customers in a given location.
